# File Viewer Component

The component responsible for displaying file content is [coderx/src/components/FileViewer.tsx](mdc:coderx/src/components/FileViewer.tsx).

- It uses the Monaco Editor (`@monaco-editor/react`) to provide syntax highlighting and editing capabilities.
- It fetches file content from GitHub raw URLs based on repository information and selected file path.
- It dynamically determines the language for syntax highlighting based on the file extension.
