# Security and Deployment

## Security Considerations

### Cross-Origin Isolation

WebContainers require cross-origin isolation to use SharedArrayBuffer:

- `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin` - Ensures the page can only be opened by same-origin pages
- `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp` - Requires all resources to be same-origin or explicitly allow cross-origin loading

Without these headers, you'll encounter errors like:
```
Failed to execute 'postMessage' on 'Worker': SharedArrayBuffer transfer requires self.crossOriginIsolated.
```

### Headers Configuration

These headers are configured in [vite.config.js](mdc:test-web/vite.config.js):

```javascript
export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    headers: {
      'Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy': 'same-origin',
      'Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy': 'require-corp',
    },
  },
});
```

## Deployment Requirements

### HTTPS Requirement

WebContainers require HTTPS in production environments (localhost is exempt during development).

When deploying:
1. Ensure your site is served over HTTPS
2. Configure the necessary security headers as defined above
3. Make sure all resources used by your application are either same-origin or set up with CORS headers

### GitHub API Rate Limits

The application uses the GitHub API, which has rate limits:
- Unauthenticated: 60 requests per hour
- Authenticated: 5,000 requests per hour

For production, consider implementing:
- GitHub authentication for higher rate limits
- Caching mechanisms to reduce API calls
- Proper error handling for rate limit scenarios
